# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

A static website for a band (the monkees) consisting of 5 different pages, a video of the band with a short description beside it, short descriptions of each member including links to the individual wikipedia pages for the band members, a page with 4 different songs to listen to and/or download, a page for all upcoming events and a final page where users can get in contact with the band for to discuss booking. The user will be able to reach any pages from anywhere as there are 4 links in the header (home, about us, media and upcoming events) and a link in the footer to reach the contact us page.

## UX


## Features

The webpage features a video that users can watch, 4 different songs that the user can listen to on the webpage itself or download for later use and a form that the user can fill out in order to contact the band.

If I had the required knowledge I'd have liked to include a calander that would have shown when upcoming events were scheduled for, instead of having to rely on changing text.

##Technologies Used
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap was used mainly for its ability to help in laying out webpages.
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Font Awesome (FA for short) was used for the icons that it includes as this help a lot with styling the webpage.
[Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) - Hover.css was used just to help with styling, it provides a nice visual indicator to the user that they have moused over one of the navigation links.
